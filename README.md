Select the appropriate debug environment for your programming language (e.g., Node.js for JavaScript, Python for Python, etc.).
If prompted, select the file to debug (usually the main entry point of your program).
VS Code will generate a launch.json file in a .vscode directory, which you can customize with your specific debug configurations.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code
Breakpoints: Set breakpoints by clicking on the left gutter of the editor or by pressing F9. When the debugger hits a breakpoint, it pauses the execution of your program, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code.
Debug Controls: Use the debug controls in the Debug view to control the execution of your program. You can step over, step into, step out, continue, restart, or stop the debugging process.
Variables: The Variables view displays the current values of variables in scope when the debugger is paused. You can hover over variables in the editor to see their values as well.
Call Stack: The Call Stack view shows the sequence of function calls that led to the current point of execution. You can navigate through the call stack to understand the flow of your program.
Watches: The Watches view allows you to monitor the values of specific expressions or variables during debugging. You can add, edit, or remove watches as needed.
Debug Console: The Debug Console provides a command-line interface for interacting with your program while it's being debugged. You can evaluate expressions, execute commands, and view debug output.
Conditional Breakpoints: Set conditions on breakpoints to pause execution only when specific conditions are met. This is useful for debugging complex scenarios or when you want to avoid unnecessary pauses.
Function Breakpoints: Instead of setting breakpoints on specific lines of code, you can set function breakpoints that pause execution whenever a particular function is called.
Logpoints: Logpoints are similar to breakpoints, but instead of pausing execution, they log a message to the Debug Console. This can be helpful for adding temporary logging without modifying your code.
Debug Adapter Protocol: VS Code uses the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) to communicate with debuggers. This allows for a wide range of debugging extensions to be developed for various programming languages and runtime environments.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
Answer: To integrate Git with Visual Studio Code for version control:
Users can initialize a Git repository in VS Code by opening the Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G) and selecting the "Initialize Repository" button. This creates a new Git repository in the current folder.
To make commits, users can stage changes by clicking the "+" button next to modified files in the Source Control view. They can then enter a commit message and click the checkmark button to commit the changes.
To push changes to GitHub, users can click the "Publish Branch" button in the Source Control view. This will create a new repository on GitHub and push the local commits to the remote repository.
Users can also clone an existing GitHub repository directly in VS Code by running the "Git: Clone" command in the Command Palette and entering the repository URL.
Overall, the Git integration in VS Code provides a user-friendly interface for managing source control, allowing developers to perform common Git actions like committing, branching, and pushing directly within the editor.
